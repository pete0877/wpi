MQP Status Report
Date: 1/25/00
__________________________________________________________________________
Things done since the last meeting:

1. Further implementation and testing of the server
(e.g. distribution algorithm was seperated from 
the rest of the system architecture to allow for
easier algorithm maintenance; logging of the system
events was improved and embeded into the Document/View 
framework)

2. More research was done on the basis for ditributed 
game-tree method comparison.

3. We put down a plan as to what will be done in order
to test the performance of our system compared to 
other systems / programs.

4. Instead of debugging the Stanback software component, 
we decided to go with the new version of GNU Chess. (v5.0)
Initial efforts were made in direction of understanding 
dependencies and services provided by the GNU component)

5. Got access to the Wine Lab (the ID cards work, but we 
didn't get our usernames and passwords yet, which disables 
us from testing our system in the lab) We installed DCom and
the Visual Studio on few of the machines. 


__________________________________________________________________________
Things to do before the next meeting:

1. Get the system to run in the WINE lab using up to 10 PCs

2. Get the GNU Chess to work within our standard plugin.

3. Resolve some DCom security and timeout issues.

4. Implement multi-level tree splitting on the server.

5. Start on integrating the chess-GUI component within 
our game client framework.
