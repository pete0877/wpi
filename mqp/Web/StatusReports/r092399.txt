MQP Status Report
Date: 9/23/99
______________________________________________________________________________
Done since last meeting:
1. Restructured the communication between client, server and helper to 
   guarantee that the server is stateless
2. Developed an initial formula to determine the time needed for a helper 
   to compute a tree of a given depth.  This formula takes into account
   communication overhead, board evaluations and move generation
3. Found article on distributed (multiple computer) game tree search
4. Developed sample DCOM application that will be used to test communication
   overhead
______________________________________________________________________________
To Do for next week:

1. Decide on strategy for dividing work into distribution units
2. Measure overhead of sample DCOM object
3. Research more on multi-computer distributed game tree algorithms
