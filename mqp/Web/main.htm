	<b><font size="3">Introduction</font></b><p>
	This is the web site for our Computer Science Major Qualifying Project at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. During the course of the project we will	develop a distributed game environment software. The software will be capable of 	computing complex game tree evaluations using multiple personal computers	located local network or the Internet.
	<p>
	During the past few years, we have seen an exponential growth in the number of computers connected to the Internet.  The rapid adaptation of the Internet presents new opportunities in the field of distributed computing that require novel approaches to familiar problems.  Distributed Game Tree Engine project is an effort to create a distributed environment that utilizes the massive computing resources available through the Internet to solve computationally intensive game tree-searching problems.
	<p>
	The purpose of this project is to develop a software application that is capable of performing distributed calculations on a game-tree.  The application will be capable of handling any tree-searching game.  For the purpose of development, we will implement a game of chess.  The computing power of the system will be distributed over the Internet among multiple computers running any 32-bit Microsoft Windows operating system.
	<p>
	As its primary goal, this project focuses on creating a generic framework that could be adapted to various games based on a game-tree searching algorithm.  The framework would provide a foundation for managing and distributing the work to other computers.  As a result, the effort involved in creating a distributed version of a game based on the tree-searching algorithm would be considerably simplified. The effort would be reduced to writing an appropriate unit specific to the game itself.  
	<p>
	The audience targeted by this project consists of individuals with personal computers and access to the Internet, who desire to play a game against a challenging computer opponent. Since the strength of the computer opponent is limited by the processing power of one's computer, a person can only play at the skill level that corresponds to the speed of that person's computer.
	<p>
	The Distributed Game Tree Engine attempts to solve that problem by allowing an individual to play against a network of computers that together create a much stronger computer opponent.  Dividing up and distributing work that would be normally performed on a single machine to a number of helper computers increases the strength of the computer opponent. Consequently, more calculations can be performed in the same period of time, leading to a more exhaustive search and a better move choice by the computer opponent.
