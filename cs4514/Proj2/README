How to compile the project:
  type 'make'

How to prepare the server and client for testing:
  type 'chmod 755 testsetup'
  type 'testsetup'
     (this will create directories where the server and the client
     can sit safely, without steping on eachother files)
  open one terminal in the 'test/srv' directory and run the server
     'server 2 3'
  open anoter terminal in the 'test' directory and run the client
     'client 1 4 get sourcefile destfile localhost'
  when the client and server are done, you will have /test/destfile
  downloaded.

  NOTE: In the test case above, you need to open both terminals on the 
  same machine. Read the Design Report for more details on the command
  syntax.

Special options:
  * CRC-32 in DLL
  * two way communication (get / put) - see Design Report for syntax
  * In addition to dropping frames we also fransfer frames, but sometimes
    with CRC errors.
