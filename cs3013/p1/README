Problem Description: 

	This program implements a small shell that is capable 
of executing external system programs / commands. Tshell has
also built in "kind" command, which allows user to set lowest 
CPU priority on ran processes. The only internal command in 
Tshell is "cd" which works just like "cd" under Unix system
shell. Tshell also calculates system usage statistics when 
terminating. These statistics tell the users what is total
CPU time used by child processes, and what are contex switches
numbers.

How to build the program:       make

How to run the program:         tshell

How to end the program:         type command "exit"
