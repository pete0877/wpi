ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS:

1.
     Can a hey process ever delete the shared memory
     segment and semaphore as another key is trying to use
     it? Why or why not? What do you think would happen
     in this case? Observe what happens in your program or
     make assumptions on what you think would happen.

It is possible, because we can't use semaphores when we
delete them. If another process tries to access deleted
semaphore, it will get -1 returned and it will end process
messaging error.

2.
     Besides using shared memory for the IPC, briefly
     describe another way to communicate between chat
     processes. Why would this way be better or worse than
     using shared memory?

We can use server process that will manage communication
between client processes, and so we don't have to worry about
deletion problem described above. In this case we would use
local memory buffer accesable through the clients only
through message methods.

3.
     Would you every want to allow more than one hey
     program to read or write the shared memory? If so,
     when? How would you modify your code to allow this?

Yes, but only if we want to allow reading and no writing
at all. This way we could probabbly speed up the turn-around
time needed for one of these processes to aquire information 
from the shared memory segment.
