Problem Description:            

To write distributed version of the hey program from project 2 with a
server and client. The server runs on one computer host and processes 
various hey commands sent by clients running on remote computer hosts. 
We used Unix sockets as the means of inter-process communication (IPC) 
between the server and the client.

How to build the program:       make
How to run the program:         
	(login to <host>)
	hey_server    
        hey <host>
